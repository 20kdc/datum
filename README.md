# Datum: Terse, human-writable data format

Datum is a terse, human-writable data format meant for quick implementation in various languages.

It has a specification, available at [./doc/src/spec](./doc/src/spec).

Implementations exist for:

* Java [./java](./java)
* Rust [./rust](./rust)

It was originally developed for use in some of my Java programs for the purpose of fulfilling the role of 'terse data language,' with some key distinctions:

* As free-form a syntax as reasonably possible.
* Avoids the problems that YAML has.
* Concise implementation.

It's intended to be reasonably readable by R6RS readers, but not a strict subset. (However, it has been used in a Java project to implement a "Javaified" Scheme dialect.)
