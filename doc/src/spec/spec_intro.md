# Specification Intro

The Datum specification is divided into three key sections and a number of appendices.

The reader specification is the sole _required_ specification required, as it defines the format. This is the file being measured to determine the complexity of the format as opposed to other, similar formats.

The implementor's notes defines additional requirements writers *should* follow when writing Datum, along with recommended design choices.

The application notes define the 'expected' document types, along with the Serde mapping.

The appendixes are simply where things such as diagrams and rationale go. They are meant to be informative only.
